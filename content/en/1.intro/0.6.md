The dashboard layer provides service status, monitoring, and cluster status information via a web-based UI.

The dashboard provides role-specific views according to user privileges. Cocktail user privileges are as follows:

* Administrator : The admin manages clusters and has administrative privileges on all Cocktail services.

* DevOps: Have administrative privileges only for one or more assigned workspaces. It provides a dashboard for each workspace, and can not manage clusters.

* Manager : A manager can access all views and information but cannot perform management actions such as creation or modification. This user privilege is granted to users who perform analyses \(e.g., status\).

Cocktail provides the following dashboard views:

* Comprehensive dashboard : A comprehensive status view of all services and clusters.

* Service management view :  Views for creating, deploying, monitoring, and operating services.

* Catalog view :  View for looking up service and platform catalogs and deployment.

* Cluster view :  View for integrated-managing and monitoring multiple clusters.

* Environment settings :  Settings view for the Cocktail platform.
