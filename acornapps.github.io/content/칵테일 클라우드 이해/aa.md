Cocktail is an `all-in-one container management platform`.

As the use of cloud computing became widespread, there has been a growing demand for infrastructure and application service management. This can be attributed to the limitations in utilizing the advantages of the cloud with past development and operations methods.

 In the applications segment in particular, there is growing demand for automation, efficiency, and integrated management, including continuous integration and delivery/deployment \(CI/CD\), migration, and multi/hybrid cloud computing.


In this context, the proliferation of container technology can be considered a natural evolution. Many companies have adopted container technology, and the trend is only continuing.

As a technology that packages applications or services into independent, executable units, containers provide the same development and operational experience regardless of infrastructure. Therefore, cloud management can be standardized, and development and operational efforts can be reduced from infrastructure to services. Notably, containers provide the advantage of managing a multi/hybrid cloud under a cohesive environment.

Cocktail applies the advantages of containers to cloud management to streamline development and operations, providing a platform for implementing a single or multi/hybrid cloud strategy.

The main features of Cocktail are as follows:
